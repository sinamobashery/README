# I Have An Idea

### SUB

a program to map a configuration file to chain of subcommand. we can use this to
simply create structure based command for organize related shell commands.

think we called this program `sub`. when we execute `sub [configuration] <ARGS>`
sub  program will look current directory for file named `configuration`, for now
think  this  is  yaml file, sub program look at this file read its structure (we
will  talk  about  its  structure  later) and maps tree kinda commands to actual
shell commands.
